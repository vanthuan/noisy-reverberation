% Example 1: 
%
% Talker and listener are facing each other in a free field. There is no
% background noise. Calculate the SII as a function of the distance between
% the talker and the listener.

% Assumptions:
% Talking effort: "normal" and "shouted" speech
% Importance function of "average speech" (default) 
% Hearing threshold is 0dB HL (normal hearing -- default)
