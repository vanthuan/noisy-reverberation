% Example 2
%
% Consider the following communication situation:
% A talker and a listener face each other and are 1m appart. There is a
% background of white noise and the talker shouts. 
% Calculate the SII for this communicaiton situation as a function of
% noise level when the listener wears hearing protection and when he
% does not wear hearing protection.
%
% Assumptions:
% Attenuation of Elvex Blue (TM) Foam Ear Plugs as listed on the companie's 
% web site (interpolated onto standard 1/3 oct band frequencies)
